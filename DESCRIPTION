Description: Unfortunately (but understandably) R has no build in connection 
    support for the user datagram protocol ('UDP'). We aim to somewhat fix that
    with the ability to send a lightweight probe and receive lightweight
    responses over 'UDP' to a target host/port. Supports Windows, macOS and Linux
    clients.
